### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Aastha Sharma!

I am a 3rd year **B.Tech student in CSE specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning**.

Since childhood, I've been captivated by technology, spending hours exploring computers and discovering the potential of the digital world. My journey in tech started with HTML and CSS in middle school, then Python and data analysis in high school. Now, as a B.Tech student, I'm diving deeper into fields like **web development**, **AI/ML**, **DevOps**, and **ethical hacking**â€”with current strengths in **frontend development** and **machine learning**.

I'm a **perfectionist** at heart, driven by **curiosity, empathy, and creativity**. My approach to problem-solving is both **logical and inventive**, always looking for ways to think outside the box and add unique elements. 

Beyond tech, I have a rich passion for **classical dance (Bharatanatyam)**, **chess**, **acting**, **calligraphy**, and **public speaking**. I've even led my team to the finals of the **Smart India Hackathon 2023**, achieving a top 5 spot, and am proud to be a **state-level chess winner**.

In a world of constant tech evolution, I stay motivated by pushing my boundaries, exploring new technologies, and continuously learning. Welcome to my GitHubâ€”where ideas meet innovation!
